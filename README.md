"eLit"

Summary

eLit stands for Electronic Literature, I am a passionate reader and when you read about 15 books a month it becomes a very 
expensive hobby so instead of buying new books all the time I created a program to find my next ebook to read free of charge.

Tech used:
- React.js 
- Express.js on Node.js
- PostgreSQL Database
- AWS S3 Cloud Storage
- Webpack
- Babel
- Axios
